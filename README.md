Welcome to this repository.

This ML project is about making predictive Machine Learning model that gives a score for a given client.
The score helps to tells either a person will pay back the credit/loan or not to the financial institution.

You'll find the code in wich I tested 5 different ML algorythms, then fine tuned the best one (with an AUC score of 70%).

A dahsboard is accessible vis this link : https://fatafatalina-p7dashboard--streamlit-dashboard-myd8hq.streamlit.app
You can test it, chose a client ( scroller on the left hand side) to find out the score for the chosen client number.
This makes it easy for a user to understand and have all the information he needs whether it's data, scores  and visualizations associated with the prediction.
